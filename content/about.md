My name is Damian, but sometimes known as tokariew, I’m a little bit unorganized, going down into things that spark my interest… My somewhat constant interest, which I will try to write about are:
 - Python
 - LaTeX
 - Fountain pens and sketches…
 - Photonics
 - Linux
 - Tabletop RPG
 - TomeNET[^1]

In the past I had some fun designing number system for fantasy systems, writing short fictional biographies, designing own fountain pens, writing tools for p2m, modifying themes for vbulletin forums, moderating forums…
