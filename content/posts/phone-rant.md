This will be a little bit messy post. I will mostly rant how smartphones changed
how software is designed nowadays, and how iritating it is for PC users.

## Mobile first or only services

This month I tried to download and read some magazine. There were three option
presented to get magazine:
 - buy physical version in form of half year or longer subscription
 - download app for iOS or Android and buy selected magazine for use only in 
 application
 - Visit third-party website and buy it there.

I thinked that third option will suit my needs, but I was wrong. Digital version
of magazines are only avaible through service app avaible for iOS, Android and
Windows. Why there is no option to download pdf, mobi or epub version? To make
it even worse, service give option to download some newspapers for Kindle. But
not for title I was interested.
After some searching i found some website which sell it and allow to download
it. So question is why on magazine website that option is not listed?
Why mention only mobile options on your website?

Another example from this month. 

### Socials network

I don't get why some social network have worse experience on desktop than on
mobile. Let's look for example for Instagram. To this day it doesn't allow in
simple manner to upload photos and videos from desktop version of website.
But after switching to mobile view in browser, uploading become possible.
How it is user friendly? You get better connection on desktop to upload files,
but we will make it not obvious how to do it.

Another example, Slowly for some time it didn't have even web version, and it
was mobile only. Now web version exist, but to sign in it require to be logged
in mobile app and scanning QR code. Scanning QR code as additional option can be
nifty, as it is done in discord… But as only way? It is weird decision.

Modern browser have so many features, that you can easly prepare only web app
and support nearly all platforms at once. You will get notification, you can
have icon on desktop with PWA, and even have some offline capibilities.
Many clients for PC are Electron based – stripped down version of Chrome.


### Steam

Steam, my dear steam… I don't get why 2fa and accepting trades require mobile
app, and don't allow for use of standard TOTP/HOTP/mOTP. At login it require
writing one-time passcode generated from mobile app like in standard OTP.
Make it that accepting trades require writing code too, and eliminate
steam guard completly. As bonus the need for cloning Steam app or having
multiple phones if you have more than one steam account will dissapear.

### Registration with phone number


### RCS and iMessage
Both of these fail to be communicators… And both fail in similiar way. As
communicator you should be avaible at nearly all imaginable platforms.
iMessage is only on iOS and MacOS. And RCS is currently messy at best.
In theory nearly all Android devices can support it in form of SMS/MMS
in drop replacement, but it still require mobile network support. So in some
countries is not yet avaible. And support for non Android platform is avaible in
two ways, both require having Android device with properly working RCS.
These ways are:
 - Google Messages for Web
 - Phone App on Windows 10 – probably work only with Samsung phones.

If you have Huawei phone, or phone without GApps, no RCS for you. If you are not
using Google Messages as your SMS app no RCS for you either. In theory Samsung
phones can use default SMS app for RCS. Tough luck if you have older midrange.
When I looked on Samsung A20e some weeks ago, RCS wasn't supported in default
app.

And even on supported phone and mobile network RCS are little finicky. 
Once a week I was reenabling RCS in Google Messages app, because for some unkown
reason RCS become disabled.

Third party app can't support for now RCS, and there are some plans to enable
RCS integration for phone manufacters in their messanging apps. And for now it
seems that RCS is depending on some google play services or framework.

I don't think RCS will be able to become more popular than SMS in 5 years.

## Navigation and UI elements.
